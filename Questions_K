This is a classification problem and this means that we can use the following algorithms:
    Logistic regression
    Decision tree
    Random forest
    Support Vector Classifications
    Stocastic Gradient Descend
    Nearest Neighbours Classifiers
    Gaussian Process Classification
    Other ensemble
    Neural Network Models
    XGBoost
